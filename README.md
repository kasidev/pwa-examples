# vorneLinks-festivalPlanner

A minimalistic progressive web app which displays the schedule of a multiday event using only javascript in the browser, CSS and HTML. No bootstrap, react or other fancy stuff.

The users can access the schedule of the event and save their favorite acts and are then able to post their favorites on the server with their custom user name. Other users can then access their favorites by fetching it from the server. By "following" other users one sees how many of their friends have also saved an act to their favorites.


I used a fork of the repo [See it live here](https://github.com/mdn/pwa-examples) to create this festival planner.
Currently the app is setup for the [47 Winterthurer Musikfestwochen](https://musikfestwochen.ch/).

I was inspired by the [festival planner app](https://timetable.fusion-festival.de) for the fusion festival 2022. GREAT WORK
